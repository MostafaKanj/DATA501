This repository contains the dataset and the python code required to create a "Geospatial Interactive Map"
The map is for a UofC DATA501 course project.

To get the map:
1) download dataset file
2) copy and paste the python code into your system
3) copy the file path from the dataset you just downloaded
4) paste the file path into the file path variable in the code
5) Run the code

Once this is done, your system will open an html page that pinpoints the sargassum location on a world map
