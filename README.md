This repository contains the dataset and the python code required to create a "Geospatial Map"
The map is for a UofC DATA501 course project.

To get the map:
1) download dataset file
2) copy and paste the python code into your system
3) copy the file path from the dataset you just downloaded
4) paste the file path into the file path variable in the code
5) Run the code

Once this is done, your system will open an html page that pinpoints the sargassum location on a world map

The code requires the following imports:
1) pandas
2) folium
3) TimestampedGeoJson from folium.plugins
4) IFrame from IPython.display

Moreover, this repository also contains the code used in order to generate Exploratory Analysis Data graphs for this project.

In order to generate these graphs, follow the steps:
1) download dataset (same dataset used for the geospatial map)
2) EDA 1-5 file, for example, contains the code used to generate graphs 1 through 5. Download the Python code and run it
3) The same can be done in order to generate the rest of the graphs
